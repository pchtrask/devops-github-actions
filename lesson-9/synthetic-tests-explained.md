# Synthetic Tests: Complete Guide for DevOps

## What Are Synthetic Tests?

Synthetic tests are **automated monitoring scripts** that continuously simulate real user interactions with your applications to detect issues before actual users encounter them. Think of them as "robot users" that never sleep, constantly checking if your systems are working correctly.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Continuous Monitoring**
Unlike traditional tests that run during development or deployment, synthetic tests run **24/7** in production:

```
Traditional Testing Timeline:
Development → Testing → Deployment → [Silent Period] → User Reports Issues

Synthetic Testing Timeline:
Development → Testing → Deployment → [Continuous Monitoring] → Proactive Alerts
```

### 2. **User Simulation**
Synthetic tests mimic real user behavior:
- **Simple**: "Is the website up?" (ping test)
- **Complex**: "Can a user complete a purchase?" (multi-step transaction)

### 3. **External Perspective**
Tests run from **outside** your infrastructure, simulating real user conditions:
- Different geographic locations
- Various network conditions
- External DNS resolution
- Third-party service dependencies

## Types of Synthetic Tests

### 1. **Availability Tests (Uptime Monitoring)**
**Purpose**: Verify services are accessible
**Frequency**: Every 1-5 minutes
**Example**:
```bash
# Simple HTTP check
curl -f https://api.example.com/health
# Success: HTTP 200, Failure: Any other response
```

### 2. **Performance Tests**
**Purpose**: Monitor response times and performance metrics
**Frequency**: Every 5-15 minutes
**Example**:
```javascript
const startTime = Date.now();
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users');
const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;

if (responseTime > 2000) {
    alert('API response time exceeded 2 seconds');
}
```

### 3. **Functional Tests**
**Purpose**: Verify specific features work correctly
**Frequency**: Every 15-60 minutes
**Example**:
```javascript
// Test user registration flow
1. POST /api/register → Should return 201
2. GET /api/users/new-user → Should return user data
3. POST /api/login → Should return auth token
```

### 4. **Transaction Tests**
**Purpose**: Monitor complete business workflows
**Frequency**: Every 30-60 minutes
**Example**:
```javascript
// E-commerce checkout flow
1. Browse products
2. Add items to cart
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Enter payment details
5. Complete purchase
6. Verify order confirmation
```

### 5. **Browser-Based Tests**
**Purpose**: Test full user interface interactions
**Frequency**: Every 60+ minutes (resource intensive)
**Example**:
```javascript
// Using Playwright/Selenium
await page.goto('https://app.example.com');
await page.click('#login-button');
await page.fill('#username', 'test@example.com');
await page.fill('#password', 'password');
await page.click('#submit');
await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
```

## Synthetic Tests vs Other Testing Types

## Implementation Example: Our Node.js API

Our synthetic test suite (`synthetic-tests-example.js`) demonstrates:

### Test 1: Health Check
```javascript
async testHealthEndpoint() {
    const response = await this.httpRequest('/health');
    
    // Verify response code
    if (response.statusCode !== 200) {
        throw new Error(`Expected 200, got ${response.statusCode}`);
    }
    
    // Verify response content
    if (response.body.status !== 'healthy') {
        throw new Error(`Expected healthy status`);
    }
    
    // Verify timestamp freshness
    const timestampAge = Date.now() - new Date(response.body.timestamp).getTime();
    if (timestampAge > 5 * 60 * 1000) {
        throw new Error('Health timestamp is too old');
    }
}
```

### Test 2: Complete User Workflow
```javascript
async testUserCreationWorkflow() {
    // 1. Create user
    const createResponse = await this.httpRequest('/api/users', 'POST', testUser);
    
    // 2. Verify creation
    const userId = createResponse.body.id;
    const getResponse = await this.httpRequest(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    
    // 3. Cleanup
    await this.httpRequest(`/api/users/${userId}`, 'DELETE');
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Test Design**
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic uptime checks
- **Add complexity gradually**: Build up to full workflows
- **Use realistic data**: Test with production-like scenarios
- **Clean up after tests**: Don't leave test data in production

### 2. **Frequency and Timing**
- **Critical services**: Every 1-5 minutes
- **Important features**: Every 15-30 minutes
- **Complex workflows**: Every 60+ minutes
- **Avoid peak hours**: Don't overload systems during high traffic

### 3. **Alerting Strategy**
```javascript
// Smart alerting example
if (consecutiveFailures >= 3) {
    sendAlert('CRITICAL: Service down for 15+ minutes');
} else if (responseTime > threshold) {
    sendAlert('WARNING: Performance degraded');
}
```

### 4. **Geographic Distribution**
- Test from multiple regions
- Consider user base locations
- Monitor CDN performance
- Verify global accessibility

## Integration with DevOps Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Synthetic Tests

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Every 5 minutes
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  synthetic-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run Synthetic Tests
      run: |
        node lesson-9/synthetic-tests-example.js https://your-api.com
    
    - name: Alert on Failure
      if: failure()
      uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
      with:
        status: failure
        text: 'Synthetic tests failed - check application health'
```

### Monitoring Dashboard Integration
```javascript
// Send metrics to monitoring system
const metrics = {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    service: 'api',
    test: 'health-check',
    status: 'pass',
    responseTime: 150,
    location: 'us-east-1'
};

await sendToDatadog(metrics);
await sendToCloudWatch(metrics);
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. **Test Data Pollution**
**Problem**: Tests create data that affects production
**Solution**: Always clean up test data
```javascript
try {
    // Run test
    await createTestUser();
    await verifyUser();
} finally {
    // Always cleanup
    await deleteTestUser();
}
```

### 2. **False Positives**
**Problem**: Tests fail due to temporary issues
**Solution**: Implement retry logic and smart alerting
```javascript
let attempts = 0;
while (attempts < 3) {
    try {
        await runTest();
        break;
    } catch (error) {
        attempts++;
        if (attempts === 3) throw error;
        await sleep(5000); // Wait 5 seconds before retry
    }
}
```

### 3. **Performance Impact**
**Problem**: Synthetic tests overload production systems
**Solution**: Rate limiting and intelligent scheduling
```javascript
// Limit concurrent tests
const semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // Max 3 concurrent tests
await semaphore.acquire();
try {
    await runTest();
} finally {
    semaphore.release();
}
```

## Metrics and KPIs

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Uptime percentage**: 99.9% target
- **Response time**: P95, P99 percentiles
- **Error rate**: < 0.1% target
- **Time to detection**: How quickly issues are found
- **Time to resolution**: How quickly issues are fixed

### Reporting Example
```
Weekly Synthetic Test Report:
- Uptime: 99.95% (Target: 99.9%) ✅
- Avg Response Time: 245ms (Target: <500ms) ✅
- Failed Tests: 2 (Target: <5) ✅
- MTTD: 3 minutes (Target: <5 minutes) ✅
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Identify Critical Paths
- What are your most important user journeys?
- Which services are critical for business operations?
- What would cause the most impact if it failed?

### Step 2: Start Simple
```javascript
// Begin with basic health checks
setInterval(async () => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/health');
        if (response.status !== 200) {
            alert('API health check failed');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        alert('API unreachable');
    }
}, 60000); // Every minute
```

### Step 3: Expand Gradually
- Add more endpoints
- Include response time monitoring
- Test complete workflows
- Add geographic distribution

### Step 4: Integrate with Monitoring
- Send results to your monitoring system
- Create dashboards and alerts
- Set up escalation procedures
- Generate regular reports

## Conclusion

Synthetic tests are essential for maintaining high-quality, reliable applications in production. They provide:

- **Proactive monitoring** instead of reactive firefighting
- **Continuous quality assurance** beyond deployment
- **User experience validation** from real-world perspectives
- **Performance baseline** establishment and monitoring

By implementing synthetic tests alongside your existing testing strategy, you create a comprehensive quality assurance system that protects your users and your business from unexpected issues.

Remember: Synthetic tests don't replace other types of testing—they complement them by providing continuous production monitoring that ensures your applications work correctly for real users, all the time.
